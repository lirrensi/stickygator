[ ] export json better have timestamp in file name
    [ ] make txt format alongside (tab = file), exactly as in zonote
    [ ] make export into zip so I can export all safely, with option to each note === separate file

What to do with mobile version, do I need to make one at all? It was not my intention and I would have to find entirely different looking solution anyway...
    - 3rd mode mobile, so it looks like in gnotes (full width or 2 rows at max and scroll down only), fixed top toolbar?
    => its a good anyway, as its like fixed with better than whacky masonry...

Add created/modified labels (toggleable probably)




Better masonry and widths...
1. Calculate number of columns, take a basis width, currently equals 300px;
window.innerWidth module 300px;
If have only one col then basis width === screen width, so no wasted space at right;
For example have 2 cols, then two by 300px;

If note native (in free mode) if less => then its 300px, if more, then take 2x300px; but at max for 2 cols so its not too much...
But can extend for 3 cols probably...

Height is always min note height and max at 2x basis;

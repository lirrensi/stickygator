======================================================================================================================
V1.7 candidate

[x] added localization;


[???? x] added delete key handler
want to change how filters are applied => unified tabs storage vs presentation mode
so Data => getter/Computable => display as is, searh and sort filters are inside those;


    so tabs also filtered not by display but also wih search function
    and notes also like that
    for grid mode - sort option? ASC/DESC => CONTENT_LENGTH + TIMESTAMPE 

========================================================================================================================
Translation ofc;

file implementation...
So like this => in tetxt inside {file:uuid} OR just keep them separate alltgether away from text?
On paste => parse clipboard and extract files into the 


[ ] weekly backup reminder
// TODO: set timeout => if not not edited in time => delete


app sickiy to translate electron and on githt

implement note dragging saving prev position - save initial position before drag as => not as actuall as I think as the goal is to move to and then switch to grab form other side;
Also in grid mode not possible to drag at all!

add image paste encoded in base64 simple with 5mb limit? or what.... or any file preferably? dunno


[-] change to interact js for better support...?
    test in separate branch, any important missing features?


    [ ] make txt format alongside (tab = file), exactly as in zonote
    [ ] make export into zip so I can export all safely, with option to each note === separate file

What to do with mobile version, do I need to make one at all? It was not my intention and I would have to find entirely different looking solution anyway...
    - 3rd mode mobile, so it looks like in gnotes (full width or 2 rows at max and scroll down only), fixed top toolbar?
    => its a good anyway, as its like fixed with better than whacky masonry...

Add created/modified labels (toggleable probably)




Better masonry and widths...
1. Calculate number of columns, take a basis width, currently equals 300px;
window.innerWidth module 300px;
If have only one col then basis width === screen width, so no wasted space at right;
For example have 2 cols, then two by 300px;

If note native (in free mode) if less => then its 300px, if more, then take 2x300px; but at max for 2 cols so its not too much...
But can extend for 3 cols probably...

Height is always min note height and max at 2x basis;
